The HW will work with the `okcupiddata` from Lab 3.

```
library(okcupiddata)
data(profiles)
```

### 1. (3 points)

What proportion of the profiles report the ability to speak `c++`? Note you can exclude profiles that report an `NA` for this response.


### 2. (3 points)

Report how many profiles were last accessed during each of the 24 hours of the day (using `last_online`)

### 3. (4 points)

Make a plot that shows the relationship between age and status. Rather than alphabetical ordering, reorder the factors in the following order: 

1. `married`
2. `seeing someone`
3. `available`
4. `single`
5. `unknown`
